About
-----
vim is awesome.
git is awesome.
fugitive is awesome.
sshfs is awesome.

But all these things together have so many awesomeness,
that put your network down.
And put fugitive down.
And put vim down.
And put you down.

And all of there is because of git through sshfs is slow as hell.
And all of there is because fugitive run local git on remote fs.

vim-refugi teaches fugitive to run not local git, but remote, and
then pass output back.


Usage
-----
Just install it to your bundle directory.
Everything should work like magic.
